                        <p class="lord__text">Aerys II Targaryen, also known as the Mad King, was the seventeenth and last Targaryen King of the Seven Kingdoms, and
                        the son of Jaehaerys II. He was married to his sister Rhaella Targaryen and had three children: Rhaegar, Viserys, and
                        Daenerys Targaryen, the latter of whom was born after her father's death. He also had two sons who died in infancy:
                        Daeron and Aegon, and a stillborn daughter, Shayna. Aerys showed great promise at the beginning of his reign, but over
                        the years he became erratic and uncontrollable. During the Duskendale Rebellion, Aerys was taken hostage by Denys
                        Darklyn, an event that finally damaged the monarch's sanity. In the last years of his reign, Aerys turned into a mad
                        tyrant, whose cruelty led to a new, larger rebellion - the rebellion of Robert Baratheon. At the end of this rebellion,
                        the Mad King was killed by his own bodyguard, Jaime Lannister, and Robert Baratheon took the Iron Throne as the victor..</p>

                        <p class="lord__text">Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, nicknamed the Joy of the Realm (in her youth) and
                        Queen-for-half-a-year (after her death), was the eldest daughter of Viserys I by his first wife, Aimma
                        Arryn, Princess of Dragonstone, and self-proclaimed Queen of Westeros during the Dance
                        of the Dragons. Rider of the dragon Syrax. As the eldest of Viserys I's surviving children, she was declared
                        heir to the Iron Throne by her father. Despite the birth of sons in his second
                        marriage, King Viserys I did not change his will, but after his death, Aegon II, Rhaenyra's half-brother,
                        challenged her claim. This led to a civil war known as the Dance
                        of the Dragons; Rhaenyra's supporters, the black party, fought against Aegon's supporters, the green party.
                        Having captured King's Landing, Rhaenyra occupied the Iron Throne for several months. Although she was eventually
                        captured and executed by Aegon II, in the following years Rhaenyra's two surviving sons, Aegon III and Viserys II,
                        became kings and continued the Targaryen dynasty.</p>

                        <p class="lord__text">Prince Daemon Targaryen was brother to King Viserys I Targaryen and later went on to marry his niece, Rhaenyra
                        Targaryen. He was known to be a cunning warrior and a skilled dragon rider. His proficiency in combat was greatly
                        recognized, and Daemon was knighted at age 16. He was later given Dark Sister — a famous Valyrian sword once used by
                        Visenya Targaryen, one of Aegon the Conquerer's sisterwives. Daemon bore many aliases throughout his life and was most
                        commonly known as the Rogue Prince. In fact, Martin even wrote a novelette about Daemon for the anthology Rogues
                        featuring Daemon called The Rogue Prince.
                        Although Daemon was, for a time, the heir to the throne since his older brother had no sons, he never sat on the Iron
                        Throne. However, during the war in the Stepstones, Daemon was unofficially titled the King of the Narrow Sea. At his
                        wife/niece's side, Daemon was one of Rhaenyra's main generals during the Dance of Dragons, the war of succession between
                        Rhaenyra and her half-brother Aegon II. He rode the dragon Caraxes and participated in many of the major battles during
                        the war.</p>

                        King Aerys II Targaryen for many years, but later fell out with him and even fought against him in Robert's Rebellion,
                        although he joined the rebels at the very last stage. King Robert Baratheon is married to his daughter, Cersei
                        Lannister, and Lord Tywin is not only the king's father-in-law, but also the crown's main creditor - the treasury owes
                        him millions of gold. The eldest son of the previous Lord of Casterly Rock, Tytos Lannister and his wife Jeyne Marbrand.
                        There were five children in Tytos' family: Tywin himself, his brothers Kevan, Tygett, and Gerion, and his sister Genna.
                        Tywin was married to his cousin Joanna Lannister, with whom he fathered the twins Cersei and Jaime, as well as the dwarf

                        <p class="lord__text">King Robert Baratheon is the first king of the Seven Kingdoms from the Baratheon dynasty, the eldest son of Steffon
                        Baratheon and Cassana Estermont, brother of Stannis and Renly. Childhood friend of Eddard Stark, with whom he was raised
                        at the court of Jon Arryn. Husband of Cersei Lannister, the children born to her in marriage - Joffrey, Myrcella and
                        Tommen Baratheon - were in fact the consequences of the vicious relationship of the queen with her own brother Jaime
                        Lannister. Cersei only once became pregnant by her legal husband, but got rid of this pregnancy. Robert also had
                        bastards from different women - Gendry, Edric Storm, Mia Stone, Barra and others. Robert came to power by rebelling and
                        overthrowing the mad Aerys II Targaryen. As a Targaryen relative, the grandson of Princess Rhaella Targaryen and the
                        great-grandson of King Aegon V, Robert had a certain claim to the Iron Throne, but he preferred to say that he had won
                        it with his warhammer. Over the years, this renowned warrior had become a fat drunk and a profligate, with little regard
                        for affairs of state. As a king, he was in many ways similar to Aegon the Unworthy, whose
                        great-great-great-great-grandson he was, both in his character and in his general appearance at the end of his life.
                        Moreover, like his unworthy ancestor, Robert plunged the country into far greater chaos after his death. His violent
                        seizure of power set a serious precedent, relying on which all the participants in the War of the Five Kings who had
                        laid claim to the Iron Throne refused to convene a Great Council to resolve the question of succession.</p>

                        Jaime Lannister. Joffrey's personal coat of arms alluded to the king's lineage. It was a divided field, with one half
                        bearing the golden lion of the Lannisters on a scarlet field, and the other the black stag of the Baratheons on a gold

                        North. He is married to Catelyn Stark, née Tully, and they have five children: Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. In
                        addition to them, Eddard has an illegitimate son, Jon Snow. Eddard is an extremely noble and honest man, a loving
                        husband and father, although his scrupulousness and loyalty to principles are considered a weakness in the capital. Like
                        many northerners, he professes faith in the Old Gods. This is one of the main POVs of the series, the most important in
                        the first book. Eddard Stark is a close friend of King Robert Baratheon. Once, when the Targaryens kidnapped Eddard's
                        sister Lyanna and executed his father and older brother, Eddard, who had unexpectedly become a lord, united the North
                        around him and helped Robert Baratheon overthrow King Aerys II. Years later, Eddard and Robert united their armies again
                        to suppress Balon Greyjoy's rebellion. At the beginning of A Game of Thrones, Robert approached Eddard with an offer to
                        become the King's Hand.</p>

                        all Starks of this generation, he is a warg, and his direwolf Grey Wind accompanied Robb to war and fought alongside
                        him. After his father's execution, he calls the banners and marches south with his army, winning one victory after
                        another. As a result, the northerners proclaim him King of the North and the Trident, and Robb subsequently fights for
                        the independence of the northern regions from the Iron Throne. Robb Stark is one of the key characters in the saga, but

                        have never manifested themselves. Sansa has a rather strained relationship with her younger sister; the girls are
                        complete opposites. According to Tyrion Lannister, Sansa has a full sense of duty and could have become a beautiful
                        queen. Dreamy and gentle, she dreamed of ballads about valiant knights and beautiful ladies, but, finding herself in the
                        harsh conditions of reality, she managed to find enough strength in herself to adapt to them and survive.</p>

                        Like all Starks of this generation, Arya is a warg, and her direwolf is Nymeria. Arya's closest relationship is with her
                        half-brother, Jon. Arya is very similar to her brother, who is in turn a copy of Ned. Jon believes that Arya, like him,
                        "was always where she shouldn't be." Only Arya could make Jon laugh. The warm relationship between brother and sister is
                        shown throughout the books. Both Arya and Jon
                        talk about each other most often. Arya is well educated. She has a good knowledge of mathematics and speaks fluent High
                        Valyrian. During her training at the Temple of the Many-Faced, Arya learned Braavosi, though she speaks it with a heavy
                        accent. Throughout the books, she has to hide her identity, and so she makes up new names for herself for almost every
                        new situation she finds herself in.</p>

                        was introduced into the narrative as Eddard Stark's bastard son, it is unknown who his mother was; in fact, it is
                        possible that Eddard is merely passing Jon off as his bastard, with another man being his father. Despite his bastard
                        origins, Jon is very similar to his Stark ancestors; like Eddard, Jon has a strong sense of honor and duty. Like the
                        other younger Starks, Jon is a warg, a shapeshifter, though he is unaware of his talent. His direwolf is an albino with
                        white fur and red eyes, the silent Ghost. Jon joined the Night's Watch during the events of the first book, and is
                        associated with the brotherhood throughout the following books. In the Watch, he became the owner of a Valyrian sword
